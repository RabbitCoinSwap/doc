You can also register your tokens in the staking menu list.

However there are a few things you have to do, first you have to send the number of tokens you want to use as your own staking reward to the [RabbitCoinVault](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x68B7c0F9E25Ee0d687662a5A030b8c54d0eD6232) contract.

After that please fill in this form, to complete your token data that you will list.
